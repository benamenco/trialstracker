    "# Finding trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov that do not have reported results\n",
    "\n",
    "Reporting of clinical trial results became mandatory for many trials in 2008. However [this paper](http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i637) and [this investigation](https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/13/clinical-trials-investigation/) both find that substantial numbers of clinical trials have not reported results, even for those trials where the FDAAA has made reporting mandatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook examines how many trials on ClinicalTrials.gov have had their results publicly reported. We have a broader definition of a trial that should report its results than the FDAAA. We count a trial as eligible for our analysis if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- it has overall status of 'Completed'\n",
    "- it has a study type of 'Interventional' \n",
    "- its completion date was after 1 Jan 2006, but is more than 24 months ago\n",
    "- it is phase 2 or later (or its phase is N/A, ie it's a trial of a device or a behavioural intervention)\n",
    "- it has no results disposition date (i.e. no application to delay results has been filed).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then classify it as overdue if it has no summary results attached on ClinicalTrials.gov, and no results on PubMed that are linked by NCT ID (see below). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is substantially broader than FDAAA, which covers only US-based trials of FDA-approved drugs. However, we think all trials should report their results, not just US-based trials, or FDA-approved drugs. In addition, FDAAA requires results to be reported within 12 months of completion, and we allow 24 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "ClinicalTrials.gov supplies notes on [how to find studies with results](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/help/how-find/find-study-results) and [results in general](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-site/results)."

    "So, for all trials that we regard as completed and due results, and that haven't already reported results on clinicaltrials.gov, we search PubMed, looking for the NCT ID either as a Secondary Source ID, or in the title/abstract. We look for anything published between the completion date and now, that doesn't have the words \"study protocol\" in the title, and that is [classified as results of a trial (using the \"therapy\" clinical keyword, broad version)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3827/#pubmedhelp.Clinical_Queries_Filters). \n",

    "Note 1: we know from [the BMJ paper](http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i637) that there are trials that do have results on PubMed, but that aren't linked using the NCT ID. The BMJ authors found these using a manual search. Some examples: `NCT00002762: 19487378`, `NCT00002879: 18470909`, `NCT00003134: 19066728`, `NCT00003596: 18430910`. We regard these as invalid, because you can only find results via an exhaustive manual search. We only count results as published for our purposes if they are either (i) submitted on ClinicalTrials.gov or (ii) retrievable on PubMed using the NCT ID. See more on this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 2: we know there are some trials that have results PMIDs directly in ClinicalTrials.gov, in the `results_reference` field of the XML. After discussion with Jess here, and Annice at ClinicalTrials.gov, I decided that these results are too often meaningless to be useful - lots of the time they aren't truly results, but are studies from years ago."
