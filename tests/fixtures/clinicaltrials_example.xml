      To evaluate maintenance of efficacy based on time to relapse between SPD489 (50 or 70mg) and
      placebo, as measured by the number of binge days (defined as days during which at least 1
      binge episode occurs) per week as assessed by clinical interview based on subject diary and
      Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scores for patients who responded to SPD489 by
      the end of the Open-label Treatment Phase.

    <description>Relapse status was assessed during the double-blind treatment phase and was defined as having 2 or more binge days per week for 2 consecutive weeks (14 consecutive days) prior to any visit and having an increase in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score of 2 or more points compared to the randomized-withdrawal baseline (date of relapse - date of randomization). Binge eating information was captured via a self-report paper diary. The binge diary captured the number of binges per day, total hours per day spent binging, type of binge (at mealtime or at another time other than mealtime), and a description of the binge (amounts and types of foods). Binge frequency was reviewed by the clinician with the subject to confirm reported binge episodes per day. The CGI-S was performed to rate the severity of a subject's condition using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill).</description>

    <description>A binge day was defined as days during which at least 1 binge episode occurred. As assessed by clinical interview based on subject binge diary. Binge eating information was captured via a self-report paper diary. The binge diary captured the number of binges per day, total hours per day spent binging, type of binge (at mealtime or at another time other than mealtime), and a description of the binge (amounts and types of foods). Binge frequency was reviewed by the clinician with the subject to confirm reported binge episodes per day. A negative change from Baseline indicates that binge-related behavior decreased. The randomized -withdrawal-baseline was defined as the weekly average number of binge days for the 14 days prior to the Randomization Visit (Visit 8).</description>

    <description>The CGI-S permits a global evaluation of a subject's condition and severity of symptoms. The CGI-S was performed to rate the severity of a subject's condition based on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill).</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Y-BOCS-BE measures the obsession of binge eating thoughts and compulsiveness of binge eating behaviors. The scale is a clinician rated, 10-item scale, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms). The scale includes questions regarding the amount of time spent on obsessions, impairment or distress experienced, and resistance and control over these thoughts. The same types of questions were asked about compulsions (ie, time spent, interference, etc.).Total scores range from 0 to 40. A total score of 0-7 is sub-clinical, 8-15 is mild, 16-23 is moderate, 24-31 is severe, and 32-40 is extreme. A decrease from baseline in Y-BOCS-BE Total Score represents an improvement in obsession with binge-eating thoughts or compulsiveness of binge-eating behaviors.</description>

    <description>The C-SSRS is a semistructured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. The interview includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behaviour occurred. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. The most severe type of ideation was rated for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason. If the answer to the first 2 ideation questions was &quot;yes,&quot; the clinician asked questions 3-5. Active suicidal ideation included any participant who answered &quot;yes&quot; to questions 2-5. If the answers to ideation questions 1 and 2 were &quot;No,&quot; then the clinician proceeded to 5 (yes/no) questions that addressed suicidal behavior, which was categorized as actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts or behaviors, and completed suicide.</description>

The ACSA total score ranges from 0-64, where a higher score indicates greater withdrawal symptom severity.</description>

          2. Subject meets the following criteria for a diagnosis of BED:

               -  Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized
                  by both of the following: eating, in a discrete period of time (eg, within a
                  2-hour period) an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people
                  would eat in a similar period of time under similar conditions, and a sense of
                  lack of control over the eating (eg, a feeling that one cannot stop eating or
                  control what or how much one is eating).
